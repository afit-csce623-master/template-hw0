This assignment is to verify that you can complete assignments using GitHub and your preferred development technique (e.g., Colab or local development).

# Instructions

1. Complete steps 1 to 3 enumerated in the Jupyter notebook.
2. Commit your completed notebook to GitHub.
3. Continue working on your notebook until your notebook passes all tests and you are satisfied with your work.
4. Upload your completed notebook to Canvas.

# Helpful Tips

- When you open the [notebook file](./hw0.ipynb), you'll see a static file. You have several options to interact with the notebook.
  - Colab Notebooks: To use Colab, you'll want to change the URL domain from `github.com` to `githubtocolab.com` and leave everything else the same. You can save your changes back to GitHub with **File -> Save a copy in GitHub**. The save dialog will allow you to select a repository and file name. In most cases, you will not need to change these values. You may also provide a commit message. Providing a memorable commit message can help you compare your progress to the auto test results provided by GitHub.
  - Local development: You may also develop locally. Use the `git clone` command to procure a local copy of the repository. To test your progress, you may periodically commit your changes locally and push them to the remote GitHub repository so that GitHub can run auto test results.
- Autotesting for this notebook has been enabled. After every commit to the GitHub repository, your notebook will be subject to a series of tests. This allows you to verify whether or not you are on the right track. Some tests will provide feedback on what you need to do to fix the error. GitHub auto test does not evaluate text fields or graphical output.
